    <h1>About Matt Riel</h1>
    <p>3/23/2024</p>
    <p>I grew up loving dinosaurs, video games, pro wrestling, baseball, basketball, football and comic book. I was just your typical late 80's - 90's kid. My friends and I, use to trade our X-Men cards during recess or drew up some super powerful Pokemon. I don't mean to brag but mine was usually the best. Those moments reading, looking at our comics and playing video games really influenced me to where I am today. My appreciation for art, the artists, and the layout design of comic books and magazines.</p>
<p>I believe that good design should not be noticed to the user. Great design has the ability to blend into the background. It has the ability to bring the content to the front and let it shine. That is what I believe great design is.</p>
<p>The best part of being a web designer is solving the problem of presenting that content on a platform that the world has access to see. I hope that I can be small part of it.</p>
