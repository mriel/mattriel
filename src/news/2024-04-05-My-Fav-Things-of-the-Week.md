Here are my favorite things for the first week of April. There's a little bit of everything in this list. You can see all the different things that peak my interest throughout the week. It often helps me to remember and keeps me on my current task, then I can go into the rabbit hole later. 

## Tech 
- [Zed code editor](https://zed.dev/) New code editor on the block
- [AnyType.io](https://anytype.io/) Interesting note taking app as an alternative to Notion
- [MNT Pocket Reform](https://www.crowdsupply.com/mnt/pocket-reform#products) Fully open source mini laptop. I wish I had this.

## EDC
- [Defy Sacoche](https://defybags.com/products/the-fiend-tote-black-x-pac?variant=48045595754795) Defy makes incredible products. They have a high cost because of the labor and high end material. Worth the cost if you can afford it.
- [Trakke Make Your Own Wee Lug](https://trakke.com/pages/trakke-make-your-own-wee-lug-messenger?variant=43850603987157) Love that the company is teaching how they made their popular messenger bag. One day I will make this!
- [American Giant Shirt Jacket](https://www.american-giant.com/products/mens-shirt-jacket-black) I've been on a lookout for a good shirt jacket with pockets and I think this may be the winner. A perfect spring/fall piece.
- [Luna Sandals](https://lunasandals.com/collections/bestsellers-overall/products/mono-winged-edition) I've been eyeing these for summer hikes.

## Games
- [Slice & Dice](https://tann.fun/games/dice/) I've recently discovered this game on my phone and I can't stop playing it. Buy it, support great independent game developers.
