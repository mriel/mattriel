During the week I like to compile a list of things I come across and put them here. More for a list for me and also I think I come
across things that other's may also like. So why not share it out. I hope that you will find something that peaks your interest.

- [HoloISO](https://github.com/HoloISO/releases) Looking to build a steam pc? Then this is the OS for you. 
- [Inclusive Sans](https://www.oliviaking.com/inclusive-sans) A great font for pretty much everything! Its the font I personally use for my website.
