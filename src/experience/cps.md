At Chicago Public Schools I was a Front-End Developer and Web Designer. I helped the web service team maintain and update the 
public website as well as various applications used by Principals, Teachers, and Parents everyday. We made applications so that
parents can easily see school districts and find information about schools. One of the biggest achievments we made was to overhaul
our public website with a whole new design as well as make it mobile friendly. This made it accessible to more parents in the city
as most people had smartphones and not always have access to a computer.
