I was responsible for managing the consumer website, wholesale website, and
subscription services. I also assisted with online
and in-person marketing campaigns. This was a fast paced environment that I learned a lot about.
Square Mile Coffee Roasters roast coffee everyday and make a point to ship out the freshest coffee possible. That usually means
once you order your coffee is shipped that day or next.
I had the opportunity to design limited products like their Peanut Butter special espresso campaign.
