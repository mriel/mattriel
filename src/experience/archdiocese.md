At the Archdiocese of Chicago I was the main Front-End Developer also in charge of a lot of design decisions related
to internal applications. I worked with internal managers and back-end developers to create and maintain applications
for local churches. One of the most major project that I was part of was creating an intranet for the entire
organization. I was in charge of design, building, and testing. We used use of our current software and built in 
Sharepoint. I met with various stakeholders and subject matter experts to create a place for all employees to get the
relevant information they need fast as well as a place that organizational messages can be shared for everyone.
