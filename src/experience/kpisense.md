At KPI Sense I was the Front-End Engineer and sole Designer for the company. I was responsible for all UX/UI. 
It was challenging and very rewarding to be in charge of all designs and usability. During my time at KPI Sense
I was able to redesign the older website and build a new one with Figma and Webflow from Squarespace. This made our product more
accessible to new customers and easier to find the information they were looking for. I also made valuable design 
changes to customer dashboards so that they can recieve their data in a clean and easy to read dashboard.
